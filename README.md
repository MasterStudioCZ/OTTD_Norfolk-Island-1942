![Promotional banner.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MasterStudioCZ/OTTD_Territory-of-Norfolk-Island-1942/refs/heads/main/banner.png)
**Territory of Norfolk Island** is an external territory of Australia, located in the Pacific Ocean between New Zealand and New Caledonia. In 2021, 2'188 people lived there.

This scenario starts in 1942, the year when Burnt Pine, the largest town in Norfolk Island, was founded. It is a 1:50 recreation of the Territory, with each tile corresponding to 50 metres. It is 256Ã—512 tiles large.

## Details
The scenario includes six settlements: Kingston (the capital), Burnt Pine (the commercial and population centre), and four smaller unofficial areas - Longridge, Steeles Point, Middlegate, and Cascade. The game script used is Villages is Villages, which makes expanding towns significantly more difficult than in base OpenTTD.
Thanks to FIRS Industries 4, a large amount of industries is available. There are multiple hotels and two beaches scattered across the map, and alcohol and wood industry chains are complete.

## Dependencies
OpenTTD should automatically install the needed game script and NewGRFs from BaNaNaS. But still, here is the list of all dependencies:

## Notes
- There might be some terrain inaccuracies due to the used heightmap.
- This map includes features that might not have been present on Norfolk Island in 1942.
- There is a hotel on Phillip Island to simulate tourist trips there. There is no real-life counterpart; the island is empty and under environmental protection in reality.
